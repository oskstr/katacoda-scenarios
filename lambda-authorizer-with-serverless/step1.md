## Step 1
Let's start by getting our feet wet with AWS Lambdas in general. First we would just like to have a simple function that returns `"Hello World!`.

Think of a project name. Got it? I'll call mine `project-red` but you can choose whatever you like. Start by creating a new folder with that name and jump to it.

`mkdir project-red`{{execute}}

`cd project-red`{{execute}}
